## Introduction

The Salable Component Library is a cutting-edge collection of web components and their React counterparts, designed to streamline the integration of payment and licensing services in web applications. Built with Stencil JS, our components offer seamless compatibility and performance across various web platforms.

This library specifically caters to developers working on SaaS products, facilitating easy integration with payment services like Stripe and simplifying the creation of versatile pricing models.

## Key Features

- **Web Components**: Crafted using Stencil JS, our web components are standards-compliant and work across all modern browsers, ensuring broad compatibility and consistent performance.

- **React Wrappers**: For projects using React, we provide wrapped versions of our web components. These wrappers maintain the flexibility and power of the original components while offering the convenience of React's ecosystem.

- **Ease of Integration**: Our components are designed to be easily integrated into your existing projects, requiring minimal configuration to get started.

- **Customizable and Scalable**: Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, our components are designed to scale and adapt to your needs.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Salable Component Library in your project, you'll need to install our package. For web components, include them directly in your HTML, and for React-based projects, import the components as shown in our documentation.

Use either the Stencil Library:

```
npm i @salable/stencil-library
```

or the React Library:

```
npm i @salable/react-library
```

Here, you'll find comprehensive guides and examples to help you understand how to implement our components in your applications effectively.
